# Assignement - Testing Mikronis website

For purpose of this project, I have selected a example of testing a webiste.
This website is an official webshop of Mikronis and url is :
https://www.mikronis.hr/

In this repository you can find few tests for trying out navigation through website. 
Also, there are some basic functionalities like adding products to the chart and 
remowing them.

Tests are written in Java programming language using IntelliJ IDEA.

The test cases are following:

* Check if the search box works correctly. In other words check does search
 engine works properly.

* After getting some search results, another test was to check if sorting function works 
how it should work.

* Test number three is to check functionality of webshop chart. Test includes adding
products into chart and removing them from chart.

* The next test tests if a click on the login button opens login form.
* final test will check does click on "Contact Us" button opening Contact Us form.

To use this project, clone this repository on your computer and open it with Intellij IDEA. 

For this project you should also have ChromeDriver and FirefoxDriver (geckodriver). If you do not have them, you can download them by opening following links.

ChromeDriver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

FirefoxDriver: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

When project is built successfully, to run tests you simply right click on Mikronis_Test_Search.java file in src/java/test package. After that click on Run Mikronis_Test_Search option to execute test. 
Once tests are finished, results will be displayed at the bottom. You can manualy start any test you want to be executed.



If there are failed tests, that means that there are bugs in application and developers should fix it in newer versions.
